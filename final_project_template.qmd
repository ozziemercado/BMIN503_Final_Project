## Overview {#sec-overview}

This project aims to analyze how families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) engage with their infant's MyCHOP accounts (an online electronic health record) to access various aspects of their childâ€™s care. The project will examine patterns of portal use, including frequency, types of information accessed, and timing, with a focus on understanding how these interactions vary across demographics and socioeconomic factors.

Two individuals I have spoken to this project about include:

1\) Shikha Sinha MD - a clinical informaticist with an understanding of online portal usage at CHOP. Along with some individuals on her team I have learned about various aspects that are attainable in our current data warehouse.

2\) Jonas Miller - a data analyst at CHOP who has assisted me in understanding how to pull from the clinical data warehouse and the appropriate tables to use

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem. This should extend what is in the @sec-overview.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

Describe the data used and general methodological approach used to address the problem described in the @sec-introduction. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

## Results {#sec-results}

Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. You may refer to the @sec-methods as needed. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

## Conclusion

This the conclusion. The @sec-results can be invoked here.
