# Evaluating Family Engagement and Disparities in Health Information Access through Patient Portal Use within a NICU

### By: Osvaldo Mercado

## Overview

This project aims to analyze how families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) engage with their infant's patient portal or MyCHOP accounts (an online electronic health record) to access various aspects of their childâ€™s care. The project will examine patterns of patient portal use, including frequency, types of information accessed, and timing, with a focus on understanding how these interactions vary across demographics and socioeconomic factors.
